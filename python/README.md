The  method in Python is part of the string class, and its primary purpose is to check if all the alphabetic characters in a string are uppercase. It is frequently used in text processing when determining whether a string satisfies certain case-related conditions. 
Return Value: A boolean value:
Returns True if all the alphabetic characters in the string are uppercase
Returns False otherwise.
Non-Alphabetic Characters: Numbers, spaces, symbols, and punctuation are ignored when determining the result.

# str.lower()
-Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
-It does not change numbers or special characters.
-Useful when you need case-insensitive comparisons, such as checking if user input matches a stored value.
# str.title()
-Capitalizes the first letter of each word and converts the rest to lowercase.
-It treats non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, hyphens) as word boundaries.
-Often used for names or titles formatting.
Note: title() doesnâ€™t always work well for words with mixed capitalization like "McDonald's" or "iPhone" (it would output "Mcdonald'S" or "Iphone")
# str.capitalize()
-Capitalizes only the first letter of the entire string.
-The rest of the string is converted to lowercase.
-Good for formatting sentences to start with a capital letter.
# str.swapcase() 
is a string method that returns a new string with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase and all lowercase letters converted to uppercase.
# str.find()
Returns the lowest index where the substring sub is found within the string.
If sub is not found, it returns -1 (instead of raising an error).
start and end are optional arguments specifying the search range.
The index where the search should begin (default is 0).
# str.index()
The .index() method is similar to .find(), but with one key difference:
Instead of returning -1 when a substring is not found, it raises a ValueError exception.
# str.startswith()
Checks if a string starts with a specified prefix.
Parameters:
prefix: The substring to check for.
start: The position to start checking.
end : The position to stop checking.
Returns True if the string starts with the prefix, otherwise False.
# str.endswith()
Checks if a string ends with a specified suffix.
Parameters:
suffix: The substring to check for.
start : The position to start checking.
end : The position to stop checking.
Returns True if the string ends with the suffix, otherwise False
# str.count()
Counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.
Parameters:
sub: The substring to count.
start : The position to start counting.
end : The position to stop counting.
Returns the count of occurrences.
# str.replace()
Replaces occurrences of a substring (old) with another substring (new).
Optional count specifies the maximum number of replacements.
# str.strip()
Removes leading and trailing whitespace (by default) or specified characters.
 # str.lstrip()
Removes leading (left-side) whitespace or specified characters.
 # str.rstrip()
This method returns a copy of the string with trailing whitespace removed. By default, it removes spaces, tabs, and newlines from the end of the string.
# str.split()
This method splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (separator). By default, it splits by any whitespace and removes extra whitespace.
# str.join()
This method returns a string that is the concatenation of the elements of an iterable (like a list or tuple), with the string on which it is called as the separator.
# str.isalpha()
Returns True if all characters in the string are alphabetic (i.e., letters only, no spaces, numbers, or symbols).
# str.isdigit()
Returns True if all characters in the string are digits (0-9).
# str.isalnum()
Returns True if all characters in the string are either letters or digits (no spaces or special characters).
