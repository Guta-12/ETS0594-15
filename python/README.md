str.lower()
-Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
-It does not change numbers or special characters.
-Useful when you need case-insensitive comparisons, such as checking if user input matches a stored value.
str.title()
-Capitalizes the first letter of each word and converts the rest to lowercase.
-It treats non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, hyphens) as word boundaries.
-Often used for names or titles formatting.
Note: title() doesnâ€™t always work well for words with mixed capitalization like "McDonald's" or "iPhone" (it would output "Mcdonald'S" or "Iphone")
str.capitalize()
-Capitalizes only the first letter of the entire string.
-The rest of the string is converted to lowercase.
-Good for formatting sentences to start with a capital letter.
